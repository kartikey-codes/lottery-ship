# LOTTERY-SHIP

Project is made for tracks:
1) 100 MINUTE HACKATHON **SPACESHIP** BY **permissionless**

The basic idea for the project is to make a nft based card lottery game where players can stand a chance to win an exclusively designed entrepreneur nft as a lottery.
In this current time when concepts of blockchain and nft and cryptos are booming with every passing day this is our attempt to help beginners and people enter this world in a very fun way and can generate or collect their first nft.
Also they will unlock some special perks in our game with each nft they collect!!
The value of the nft will be subject to change as per the Entrepreneurship real time value.
**And like mutual funds our nft card values will also be subject to market risks ;)**

WORKFLOW of our web-app:

1) people come to our application register themselves **link their metamask wallet**.

2) they play our game which is basically a memory card game with cards as  NFT's of Entrepreneurs.

3) we will have a leaderboard on our platform and every week to the top 10 players on our site (that to be decided by the frequency they play and win on our site,
we will do a lucky draw to give one of our exclusive nft to one of the players.

4) we will mint our nft on rarible and transfer it to the lucky winner!!

***Future endeavours:***

**we will create our one web3 game where the nft holders will have some special perks**


We will also keep an option for players to upgrade their card level by paying some minimal fee.



What all we have completed till now !!
1)**created game with Entrepreneurs nft's**
2)**linked metamask wallet to store nft's**
